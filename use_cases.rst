Use Cases
=========

These use cases have been sourced through many conversations with the
community. For every use case, MolSSI will partner with pre-existing experts in
the field. These use cases are the top use cases suggested by discussing this
project with ~40 groups. As a note, some of the use cases may not be executed
by MolSSI, but the technology will be available.

- **UC1**: I am a new student who is interested in machine learning, and I would
  like to obtain the ANI-1 dataset or similar in a format compatible with Keras
  using a single line of code to get started.

- **UC2**: I am an academic or industrial partner who wishes to use quantum
  chemistry methods to generate bespoke parameters for a new drug molecule using
  a pre-existing database of quantum chemical data, or contribute molecules
  covering regions of chemical space to be included in general organic small
  molecule force field parameterization (e.g. in conjunction with OpenFF).

- **UC3**: I am a researcher who would like to benchmark a new methodology and
  would like reference datasets and the ability to compare results easily.

- **UC4**: I have a set of reactions that look like the following … Which DFT
  methods historically give the best results for similar reactions?

- **UC5**: We want to compute an open AI database to accelerate drug discovery and
  cheminformatics research, subscribe to our BOINC server. Highly visible to a
  community outside of CMS.

- **UC6**: I am running many computations and I would like to query the database to
  see if they have already been completed.

- **UC7**: I am a researcher who needs to compute a very large open dataset for
  (many-body force fields, ML-based force fields, method comparisons, etc) and I
  need help deploying software to support this. This also applies to industry
  with closed datasets.

- **UC8**: I have a few reactions and would like to see if I need to run new
  benchmark energies on them all or if some have already been performed.

- **UC9**: I am a researcher who has just published a large dataset, and I neither
  want my results to get buried in CSV in a Supplemental Material tarball, nor do
  I want to receive email inquiries, nor do I want to design a web portal for
  others to access.

- **UC10**: I am a PI, and I don’t want to task my graduate students and postdocs
  with learning databases and distributed queueing systems.

- **UC11**: I am a researcher in a multi-university collaboration with a neat idea
  I want to test quickly. My collaborator and I each have local and university
  computing resources we can allocate to the project, as well as an NCSA
  allocation. I want to make sure all my calculations are run the same way and
  not spend my days submitting and herding input/output files.

- **UC12**: I want to enable “O(0)” quantum chemical calculations by having my
  quantum chemistry code deposit results in a database automatically, querying it
  before a computation to see if the effect may already exist. The resulting
  datasets may also be useful to those doing machine learning from large QC
  datasets.

- **UC13**: I want to publish a static workflow which accomplishes a single task
  and allow users and developers to run this static workflow. An example of this
  would be to compute IR spectra with peak broadening which would involve many
  quantum chemistry computations.
